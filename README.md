# colour-sensor
A color sensor detects the color of an object by measuring reflected light and identifying its RGB values. Using a microcontroller, it analyzes the signals to determine the exact color. It is widely used in robots, sorting systems, and automation for accurate color detection.
The system works by shining light on the object and measuring the intensity of the reflected light. The sensor then converts this information into electrical signals that a microcontroller (like Arduino) can read. Based on these readings, the program identifies the closest matching color and displays it on a screen or through LEDs.

This project showcases the application of sensors in automation, robotics, sorting systems, and smart devices.
